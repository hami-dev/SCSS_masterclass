                We make furniture for modern homes. Tolv means “12” in Danish, describing a framework for living that’s centred around your day. Our thoughtful and considered pieces work for you around the clock.

                    Tolv upholds the Scandinavian ideals of well-made, well-designed furniture, yet has an appreciation of diverse cultures and an international outlook.

                    For our global customer, we call on designers from across the world to create original furniture, based on their expert sensibilities. Like them, we are obsessive about the finer details, and the collection is made in our own factory where we can keep a keen eye on cost and quality.
                </span>
                <span>
                    We believe good value is about staying useful over time. With our collection, your investment in good furniture will go far. We take a world-view on environmental issues and believe in sourcing and treating the raw materials we use with respect and care. Tolv is committed to producing responsibly and fairly, for everything we make and everyone that works for us.
